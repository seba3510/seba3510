# Hello, I'm Sebastian Corporan Berrios!

I'm a student at the University of Puerto Rico at Bayamon, and I'm enthusiastic about coding despite being relatively new to the world of programming. I'm passionate about learning and continually improving my skills to become a better developer.

## About Me

I am a passionate and curious person that loves to code.  Currently I am doing my bachelors degree in System Informations at the University of Puerto Rico at Bayamon. 

## My Coding Journey

Before entering College I had no idea how to code but loved the idea of it.  My first few semesters I really struggled with solving problems,  learning a programming language was not a challenge if not the problemn
solving aspect that comes with coding.  I have never been a great problem solver, My first 2 semesters I was horrible at it.  So horrible that I did not understand basic things such as finding the sum of an array ( yes I was that bad).  But despite being a bad problem solver I had the interest passion to get better.  Compared to how I was when I started I have made massive improvments but I am not satisfied with my abilities to solve a problem.  Having ADHD has played a huge role in my struggles to be a better problem solver but I will continue to work hard to improve such aspect.  
## Projects


## Goals

As mentioned above, my main goal as I head into my second semester of my third year is to continue to improve my problem solving.
